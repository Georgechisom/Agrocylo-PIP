# ProductionEscrowContract & RegistryContract Integration

This document describes how the `ProductionEscrowContract` and `RegistryContract` interact during the campaign lifecycle, which contract owns each piece of state, how events should be indexed, and example transaction flows.

## Overview

- **ProductionEscrowContract** owns campaign financial state (funding, escrow, disputes, settlements) and emits canonical events for every state change.
- **RegistryContract** owns the audit trail of campaign activities and access-control lists (admin, approved contracts). It is the source of truth for *who* did *what* and *when*.

In the intended integration, `ProductionEscrowContract` (or an authorized backend service acting on its behalf) calls `RegistryContract::record_activity` after each significant lifecycle step. The `ProductionEscrowContract` address must first be registered in the `RegistryContract` via `approve_contract`.

## Contract Responsibilities

### ProductionEscrowContract

| Responsibility | Implementation |
|----------------|----------------|
| Campaign creation & metadata | `create_campaign` |
| Receiving investor contributions | `receive_contribution` |
| Marking a campaign as fully funded | `complete_funding` |
| Releasing tranches to the farmer | `release_tranche` |
| Recording harvest milestones | `report_harvest` |
| Opening & resolving disputes | `open_dispute`, `resolve_dispute` |
| Investor refunds after resolution | `claim_refund` |
| Final campaign settlement | `settle_campaign` |
| Event emission for all state transitions | Soroban events (see table below) |

### RegistryContract

| Responsibility | Implementation |
|----------------|----------------|
| Admin management | `initialize`, `update_admin`, `get_admin` |
| Approved-contract allowlist | `approve_contract`, `revoke_contract`, `is_contract_approved` |
| Recording campaign audit activities | `record_activity` |
| Retrieving campaign activity history | `get_campaign_activities` |
| Event emission for registry changes | Soroban events (see table below) |

## State Ownership

| State | Owner | Storage Type | Key / Notes |
|-------|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Admin address | RegistryContract | Instance | `DataKey::Admin` |
| Approved contract list | RegistryContract | Instance | `DataKey::ApprovedContract(Address)` |
| Campaign activity history | RegistryContract | Persistent | `DataKey::CampaignActivities(u64)` |
| Campaign metadata (farmer, target, token, deadline, harvest) | ProductionEscrowContract | Persistent | `DataKey::Campaign(u64)` |
| Campaign financials (`total_funded`, `released`, `refundable`) | ProductionEscrowContract | Persistent | Inside `Campaign` struct |
| Campaign status | ProductionEscrowContract | Persistent | `Campaign.status` (`CampaignStatus`) |
| Investor contribution ledger | ProductionEscrowContract | Persistent | `DataKey::Contribution(u64, Address)` |
| Dispute record | ProductionEscrowContract | Persistent | `DataKey::Dispute(u64)` |

> **Rule of thumb:** Financial and dispute state lives in `ProductionEscrowContract`. Audit and access-control state lives in `RegistryContract`.

## Rounding / Dust Policy

Both `claim_refund` and `claim_return` compute the investor's pro-rata share via integer division:

```
share = contributed * pool_amount / total_funded
```

where `pool_amount` is either `refundable` or `returnable`. This truncates toward zero, meaning each investor may receive a few stroops less than their exact fractional entitlement. The truncated "dust" remains permanently in the contract — there is no sweep or recovery function.

**Integrator guidance:**

- `sum(all claimed refunds) <= refundable` and `sum(all claimed returns) <= returnable` always hold.
- The residual `pool_amount - sum(claimed)` represents accumulated truncation dust and should be expected in analytics or campaign close-out reporting.
- For typical campaign sizes the dust per investor is at most 1 stroop; accumulated dust across many investors is negligible in practice.

## Campaign Lifecycle

The logical lifecycle maps to the contract statuses as follows:

| Logical Phase | Contract Status | Triggering Escrow Method |
|---------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| **Funding** | `Active` | `create_campaign` |
| **Funded** | `Funded` | `complete_funding` |
| **InProduction** | `Funded` | `release_tranche` (one or more calls) |
| **Harvested** | `Funded` | `report_harvest` |
| **Settled** | `Settled` | `settle_campaign` |
| **Disputed** | `Disputed` | `open_dispute` |
| **Resolved** | `Resolved` | `resolve_dispute` |

> **Note:** `Failed` is not a distinct on-chain status. A campaign that never reaches its target by the deadline is considered *Failed* off-chain by the backend/indexer.

### Lifecycle Diagram

```
[Funding / Active]
       |
       v
[Funded] <-----------------------+
   |                             |
   |--[release_tranche]--> [InProduction]
   |                             |
   |--[report_harvest] ---> [Harvested]
   |                             |
   v                             |
[Settled]                       |
   |                             |
   | (alternative paths)         |
   |                             |
   +--[open_dispute] --------> [Disputed]
   |                             |
   |<--[resolve_dispute] ---- [Resolved]
   |                             |
   +--[claim_refund] --------> [RefundClaimed]*
```

\* `RefundClaimed` is a per-investor action, not a global campaign status transition.

## Expected Call Flow Between Contracts

The table below shows the expected cross-contract calls. After each escrow action, the escrow contract (or an approved orchestrator) should invoke `RegistryContract::record_activity` to append an audit entry.

| Escrow Action | Registry Call | `ActivityAction` | Actor |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|-------|
| `create_campaign` | `record_activity(campaign_id, farmer, CampaignCreated)` | `CampaignCreated` | Farmer |
| `complete_funding` | `record_activity(campaign_id, farmer, CampaignFunded)` | `CampaignFunded` | Farmer or Admin |
| `release_tranche` | `record_activity(campaign_id, recipient, FundsReleased)` | `FundsReleased` | Farmer (recipient) |
| `report_harvest` | `record_activity(campaign_id, farmer, HarvestReported)` | `HarvestReported` | Farmer |
| `open_dispute` | `record_activity(campaign_id, opener, DisputeInitiated)` | `DisputeInitiated` | Investor / Farmer / Admin |
| `resolve_dispute` | `record_activity(campaign_id, admin, DisputeResolved)` | `DisputeResolved` | Admin |
| `settle_campaign` | `record_activity(campaign_id, farmer, CampaignSettled)` | `CampaignSettled` | Farmer |
| `claim_refund` | `record_activity(campaign_id, investor, CampaignStatusChanged)` | `CampaignStatusChanged` | Investor |

> **Prerequisite:** The `ProductionEscrowContract` address must be `approve_contract`'d in the `RegistryContract` so that activity recording can proceed without requiring per-transaction user authorization inside the registry.

## Event Indexing Responsibilities

Backend indexers should consume events from **both** contracts. The recommended approach is:

1. **Reconstruct financial state** from `ProductionEscrowContract` events.
2. **Verify audit trail** against `RegistryContract` events (and/or on-chain `get_campaign_activities`).
3. **Track access-control changes** from `RegistryContract` events.

### ProductionEscrowContract Events

| Event Symbol | Topics | Payload | When to Index |
|--------------|--------|---------|---------------|
| `CampaignCreated` | `("CampaignCreated", campaign_id)` | `(farmer, timestamp, target_amount)` | New campaign available for funding. |
| `ContributionReceived` | `("ContributionReceived", campaign_id)` | `(investor, timestamp, amount)` | Update total funded amount and investor position. |
| `CampaignFunded` | `("CampaignFunded", campaign_id)` | `(timestamp, total_funded)` | Campaign moves from `Active` to `Funded`. |
| `TrancheReleased` | `("TrancheReleased", campaign_id)` | `(recipient, timestamp, amount)` | Escrow balance decreases; farmer received funds. |
| `HarvestReported` | `("HarvestReported", campaign_id)` | `(farmer, timestamp)` | Harvest milestone reached. |
| `DisputeOpened` | `("DisputeOpened", campaign_id)` | `(opener, reason, timestamp, ledger_sequence)` | Campaign status locked to `Disputed`. |
| `DisputeResolved` | `("DisputeResolved", campaign_id)` | `(admin, resolution, payout_to_farmer, refundable_to_investors, timestamp, ledger_sequence)` | Campaign status moves to `Resolved`. |
| `RefundClaimed` | `("RefundClaimed", campaign_id)` | `(investor, timestamp, amount)` | Individual investor refunded; zero out contribution. |
| `CampaignSettled` | `("CampaignSettled", campaign_id)` | `(farmer, timestamp, final_amount)` | Campaign moves to `Settled`; final payout recorded. |

### RegistryContract Events

| Event Symbol | Topics | Payload | When to Index |
|--------------|--------|---------|---------------|
| `act_rec` | `("act_rec", campaign_id)` | `(actor, action_type, timestamp, ledger_sequence)` | New audit record appended. Useful for off-chain audit dashboards. |
| `cont_appr` | `("cont_appr",)` | `contract` | A contract was approved to record activities. |
| `cont_revo` | `("cont_revo",)` | `contract` | A contract approval was revoked. |
| `admin_upd` | `("admin_upd",)` | `(old_admin, new_admin)` | Registry admin changed. |
