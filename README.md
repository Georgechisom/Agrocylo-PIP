# 🌾 Agrocylo Production Investment Platform

A decentralized platform for agricultural financing and trade building on the Stellar Network.

## Overview

Agrocylo brings together two core systems:

- **[P2P Escrow Marketplace](https://github.com/Cylo-Traders/Agrocylo-Global)** for direct farmer–consumer transactions
- **Production Investment Layer** for campaign-based agricultural funding

This repository focuses on the Production Investment Layer, where users fund farming campaigns and share in harvest outcomes.

## Vision

The project aims to build a decentralized agricultural economy where:

- farmers access fair financing
- buyers access transparent markets
- investors support real-world production

## Architecture

Frontend → Backend → Smart Contracts

- **Frontend**: web application user interface
- **Backend**: indexing, APIs, analytics, and business logic
- **Smart Contracts**: Soroban contracts handling escrow and campaign workflows

Main smart contracts:

- `ProductionEscrowContract`
- `EscrowContract`
- `RegistryContract`

## Key Features

### Campaign-Based Financing

- Farmers create campaigns with funding targets, production timelines, and harvest expectations
- Investors participate early in the agricultural value chain

### Pooled Investments

- Multiple investors can fund a campaign
- Ownership and returns are distributed proportionally

### Escrowed Capital

- Funds are held in on-chain escrow
- Releases happen in controlled tranches based on campaign progress

### Harvest & Settlement

- Farmers report harvest outcomes
- Smart contracts settle funds and returns according to the campaign rules

### Dispute Resolution

- Multi-party dispute flow for campaign disagreements
- Admin arbitration included in the initial version
- Possible outcomes:
  - full refund
  - partial settlement
  - full payout

### Analytics & Price Discovery

- Regional pricing insights
- Demand vs. supply signal tracking

### Registry Layer

## Campaign Lifecycle
